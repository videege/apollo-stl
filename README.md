## Introduction

Apollo is a tool built to help miniature painters visualize lighting scenarios for STL files they are 3D printing.  The tool allows you to load an STL File and then add lighting to the scene.  You can then take pictures of the model from any angle for future reference.

*Features*:
- Load STL files
- Configure zenithal lighting intensity and color
- Add up to 5 lights from any angle and control their intensity and color
- Rotate the imported model as necessary
- Save a screenshot of the model from any angle
- Save 12 "360 degree" snapshots of the model as a convenience

Apollo currently has releases for Windows.  I may take a look at releasing for Mac/Linux in the future.
